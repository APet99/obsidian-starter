### Unrequited Notes
These notes point directly to this note. But this note doesn't point back.
This is the strongest contextual query. (Lists MoC pointing to concepts)

```dataview
LIST

FROM [[Typescript MoC]]
and outgoing([[Typescript MoC]])
and -#map

SORT file.link asc
```

### Possibly Relevant, Currently Unmentioned Notes
These notes have the tag `#concept`, and are not mentioned aboveâ€”but could be relevant.
This is a nicely fuzzy contextual query.

```dataview
LIST 

FROM #concept/typescript
AND !outgoing([[Typescript MoC]])
AND !"Extras/Templates"
SORT file.link asc
```
